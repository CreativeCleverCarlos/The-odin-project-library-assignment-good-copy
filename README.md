# The Odin Project: Library Project

The following shows my code for "The Odin Project: Library Project". To see the full assignment, click [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library).

This project will show the user 3 manga examples by default. Each entry will show the user the title of the manga, the author, and the number of volumes. You can also select the book emoji to show whether the manga has been read or not.

To further improve the code, an edit button could be added, and better CSS could be implemented for the image container. Also, responsive parameters could be implemented.
